* Introduction
Emacs is the best text editor out there, you should probably use it.

This configuration was tested on Linux and focuses on simplicity and reproducibility.
It’s designed to be easy to install and replicate on a new device with minimal setup.
Wherever possible, I rely on Emacs’ built-in features to reduce external dependencies.
